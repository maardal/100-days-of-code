# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
Feb 16, 2026.

## My personal rules
1. I will post about my progress every day on hashtag #100DaysOfCode on Bluesky, Post a message about my progress in [FreeCodeCamp Discord](https://discord.com/invite/freecodecamp-692816967895220344), and SnapChat my friends about my progress.
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))
