### Day 0: February 16, 2026

**Today's Progress**:
- Add Valorant Premier Season performance to achievements on Premier Team website.
- Fix bug where color on nav items werent shown.

**Thoughts:** I struggled getting started, getting lost on the phone and other stuff. However, when I started it went smoothly. I started easy on a familiar hobby project that had a small bug I could fix.

### Day 1: February 17, 2026

**Today's Progress**:
- Re-familiarize myself with an old hobby project.
- Start on new feature. 

**Thoughts**: I started on another project that yesterday, because this had more work to do. It was a very slow start, and I got a bit demotivated because I had forgot a lot. Stopped because I had a meeting. Started up again some time before bed, and then it went a bit easier. I could write code kinda freely without checking documentation or using AI.

### Day 2: February 18, 2026

**Today's Progress**:
- Contined work on hobby project for keeping track of when I last hung out with friends or family.
- Finished first workable implementation of adding a hangout for loved one.

**Thoughts**: Motivation was a lot higher today, as I decided to be kind on myself and not overload my day with stuff to do. Having a workable way to add hangouts was great and gave me a dopamin boost. Makes me more motivated to tighten up the quality of the code on both frontend and backend. Might work more on it later today, but then will count that work for tommorow, as I've already written this log.

### Day 3: February 19, 2026

**Today's Progress**:
- Contined work on hobby project for keeping track of when I last hung out with friends or family.
- Created first draft of a store for an entity.

**Thoughts**: Struggled with starting today, even tho I felt motivated throughout the day. Ended up starting close to midnight. Gonna try to not get so distracted tommorow.
