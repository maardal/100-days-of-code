### Day 0: February 16, 2026

**Today's Progress**:
- Add Valorant Premier Season performance to achievements on Premier Team website.
- Fix bug where color on nav items werent shown.

**Thoughts:** I struggled getting started, getting lost on the phone and other stuff. However, when I started it went smoothly. I started easy on a familiar hobby project that had a small bug I could fix.
